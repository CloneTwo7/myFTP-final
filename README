### Systems Programming CS 360 Final ###
### Travis M. Peterson | Dec 9 2022  ###

The final consists of two executables. A server and a client.
By running the server in one directory, you can run the client in another.
You can have multiple clients connected to the same sever.

------------------------------------------
The user can interface with the server through the client with the following commands:

'cd <pathname>'  --- changes the local directory on the client

'rcd <pathname>' --- changes the remote directory on the server

'ls' 		 --- lists the contents of the local directory in accordance with 'ls -l -a' 20 lines at a time

'rls'		 --- lists the contents of the remote directory in accordance with 'ls -l -a' 20 lines at a time

'get <pathname>' --- transfers the contents of the regular file at <pathname> to the local repo for the client

'show <pathname>'--- displays the contents of the regular file at <pathname> to the client 20 lines at a time

'put <pathname>' --- transfers the contents of the local regular file at <pathname> to the server's current repo

-----------------------------------------

This assignemnt utilizes many system calls such as read, write, fork, exec, and stat. It even demonstrates an
understanding of how to manage a datastream between two remote connections.
-----------------------------------------

The assignment comes complete with a makefile complete with these following commands:

- make - builds both executables
